# Genetic Algorithm for Equation Solving

This Python script implements a genetic algorithm to find values for variables (a, b, c, d) that satisfy the equation `a + 2b + 3c + 4d - 30 = 0`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install deap
  ```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ryan-PG/genetic-algoritm-equation-solving.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd genetic-equation-solving
   ```

3. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python genetic-algoritm-equation-solving.py
   ```

   This will execute the genetic algorithm and print the best solution found.

## Customization

You can customize the genetic algorithm parameters and the equation to be solved in the `genetic_algorithm.py` file. Adjust the bounds for variables, population size, mutation rate, and other parameters based on your specific problem.

## File Structure

- `genetic_algorithm.py`: Main script containing the genetic algorithm implementation.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- `.gitignore`: File to specify which files and directories to ignore in version control.

## Acknowledgments

- This code uses the [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) library for evolutionary algorithms in Python.

Feel free to fork, modify, and use this code for your university exercises. If you find it helpful, consider giving it a star!
Also Make sure to create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your project with the specified content to ignore the `.venv` folder.
